# Blog-w-Django

This project is inspired by freeCodeCamp.org
more specifically this youtube video:
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzwzrDvZ18&t=20225s)

Instructor is CodeWithTomi, all work done is by following
his instructions. None of this work is my own.

This project teaches the fundamentals of backend properties
using django. And eventually using the knowledge to create 
my own blog template in this manner, with my own styles.
